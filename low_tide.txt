# Need to do more showing and less telling - doing a lot of "telling" in here...

# How can we "show" remembrance?

The man wakes up, turns over, and like most mornings (at least those of the last twenty-six years) watches for the slow undulation of the white sheets and listens for the slow inhale and exhale of his wife's unconscious breathing. This morning the covers are still and the only breath he hears is his own.

Something catches in his throat and he feels too hot under the thin sheet. His eyes never leave the bared shoulder framed by the sheet's edge. He holds his breath. The absence of any other sound amplifies the pounding of his heart.

Time passes. He exhales and takes a stuttered breath in. His arm shakes as he reaches out to touch her skin.

	“Sleep well my love,” she says.
	“And you.” He turns off the lamp.

His fingers touch her shoulder. He feels the cold. His face twists, his stomach follows. 

	In a bright hospital room, light streams in though a large window onto a small bed and the yellowing woman in it. The scent of urine and antibacterial soap hangs in the air. Older voices say he should kiss his mother one last time. He turns the headphones' volume knob up and walks out the door.

His body collapses in on itself, abdominal muscles contract, the biological imperative of self protection takes over. A cry is squeezed out.

	He stares at her across the table after his last bite of eggplant parmesan. She smiles at him when she notices him staring.

When he opens his eyes the room is too bright and blurry. He convulses again, staccato cries muffled as his face meets the pillow.

	It's Sunday afternoon. He lies on the second-hand sofa reading Chekov and she is in the armchair flipping through a book of Rembrandt paintings. A lonely stick of patchouli incense smolders in a small porcelain vase on the plastic coffee table between them. He looks up and sees her wrinkling her forehead in thought. He smiles.

His lungs force him to inhale, drained of oxygen for too long. He quickly expels the breath, voicing sounds only the lost can understand.

	A late night and they are taking a cab home. Four slices of pizza are going cold in paper bag at his feet. His wife peels his hand from the vinyl seat and puts it to her chest, squeezing it against her warm body with both arms.

# Need to have something in here - something banal - something he'll get frustrated with because he thinks it is the only thing he'll ever be able to remember
Once the shaking slows he tries to remember her.

	She is sitting in the bed working on her laptop, its fan whirring loudly. He turns away, just wanting to sleep.

He tries again.

	She is looking up at him that first night in the bar. There is something about the way the grey of her shirt brings out the green in her eyes. He shouldn't rush this one.

There are things he needs to do but the bed is where he wants to be. He can’t touch her, but he can’t leave her. He knows as soon as he gets out of bed he will start forgetting. The memories he would later go back to over and over, for that was all he had left of her now, would slowly crystalize, becoming singular visions made of images alone, distilled further with each remembrance, nothing chaining them to the current moment.

# Maybe during this stuff he is trying to remember something other than the banal memory from before
The bark of a far away dog echoes off a nearby building. The man rises and walks to the phone hanging on the wall with its archaic ten foot cord. He calls a number and talks to someone. He turns and sees his wife's face. She is still sleeping. He wants to bend down and kiss her, he wants her to wake up and smile. He turns away, his vision going blurry again. He goes back to his side of the bed and sits. He closes his eyes trying to forget everything that has happened since he opened his eyes this morning.

"Please," he thinks to himself, "just another minute, just one..."

Time passes and the room fills with people. The paramedics file in with their equipment. He sits on the bed facing away as they pick her up, placing her on the gurney. He tries to remember something else, anything else about his life with this woman. He is interrupted. Words are exchanged, papers are signed.

Later his brother and sister are there. Eventually he gives up trying to remember. He tries not to leave the bed. She was here just a moment ago. He desperately needs to pound his head against a wall, but rocks on the bed instead. His sister holds him.

His brother walks over to the window. He draws open the blinds and opens the window. He walks over to the other window and repeats the action. A cool cross-breeze passes through the warm room.

The breeze carries the scent of a jasmine plant that climbs up the side of the building. He remembers the summer day the two of them planted it. She demanded a trellis because she liked to plan ahead. He smiles. He inhales deeply letting the memory replay in his mind with every inhalation.
