He remembers them as slow undulations, the regular rising and falling, the crests and troughs of waves. He would wake before she did and lie on his side watching her breathe. Sometimes he would hear her breathing, other times he would notice only the movement of the cover. This morning his wife made no sound and the cover made no movement.

He stares, praying it is a trick of time. It must be his mind strangely stretching the moment, slowing it down, making all movement imperceptible. Frozen, his mind races, filled with the past and future split by this single moment.

He eventually convinces himself to move. With dread, he reaches out to touch her. He knows it will be cold; his wife is no longer there.

“Sleep well my love.”
“And you.” He turns off the lamp.

His fingers touch her bare shoulder. He feels the cold. His face twists, his stomach follows suit. He cries out and tears fill his vision.

Through the seeming eternity of sorrow-filled convulsions, some with face buried in pillow, others screaming, eyes shut, at the ceiling, he remembers the small moments.

He is staring at her across the table after he had finished his meal and she smiles at him when she notices his stare.

It is a long slow Sunday afternoon. They are sitting in the living room, each of them reading a book. He is comforted just by his proximity to her.

They are holding hands in the back of a cab, for no reason.

Once the shaking slows he tries going back to one of those times. He wants to feel those feelings again, to notice something new. He tries, but they are brief and without the spark of real experience.

He can smell her on the sheets; that sweatiness he had found strange twenty-odd years ago, but now misses if he travels too many days a quarter.

He wants to hold her one more time; to feel her expand and contract in his arms, but he never will.

He would sleep alone tonight. He could already feel the absence in the room, in the bed.

She is looking up at him that first night in the bar. There is something about the way the grey of her shirt brings out the green in her eyes. He won't rush this one.

There were things he needed to do but the bed was the place he wanted to be. He couldn’t touch her, but he wouldn’t leave her.

He was certain as soon as he got out of the bed he would start forgetting. The memories he would go back to over and over, for that was all he had left now of her, would slowly crystalize, would become singular visions made of images alone and without the breath of life.

The echoes of a dog barking bounce off a nearby building. The man turns to watch the sunlight make lines across the hardwood floor. The only sound in the room is the that of his own breathing.
