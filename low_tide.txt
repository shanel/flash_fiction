He remembers them as slow undulations, a regular rising and falling, like the crests and troughs of waves. He would wake before she did and lie on his side watching her breathe. Sometimes he would hear her breathing, other times he would notice only the movement of the cover. This morning the room was silent and the covers still.

He stares. He prays it is a trick of time. It must be his mind strangely stretching the moment, slowing it down, making all movement imperceptible. Frozen, his mind races, filled with the past and future split by this single moment.

He eventually convinces himself to move. He reaches out to touch the bared shoulder. He knows she will be cold; his wife is no longer there.

	“Sleep well my love.”
	“And you.” He turns off the lamp.

His fingers touch her bare shoulder. He feels the cold. His face twists, his stomach follows. He pulls away, moaning, as tears fill his vision.

Through the seeming eternity of sorrow-filled convulsions, some with face buried in pillow, others with eyes shut and crying out at the ceiling, he remembers the small moments.

	He stares at her across the table after his last bite of eggplant parmesan. She smiles at him when she notices him staring.

	It's Sunday afternoon. He lies on the second-hand sofa reading Chekov and she is in the armchair flipping through a book of Rembrandt paintings. He looks up and sees her wrinkling her forehead in thought. He smiles, happy just to be near her.

	It is late at night and they are taking a cab home. She holds his hand, as it rests on the sticky vinyl seat.

Once the shaking slows he tries going back to one of those moments again. He wants to feel that happiness again, to get away from the pain he knows is ahead. He tries, but they are too brief and he can't stay there long enough.

He can smell her on the sheets; the sweaty scent of her hair he found strange twenty-odd years ago, but now misses if he travels too many days a quarter.

He wants to hold her once more. He wants to feel her expand and contract in his arms.

He will sleep alone tonight. He already feels the absence in the room, in the bed.

	She is looking up at him that first night in the bar. There is something about the way the grey of her shirt brings out the green in her eyes. He won't rush this one.

There are things he needs to do but the bed is where he wants to be. He can’t touch her, but he can’t leave her. He knows as soon as he gets out of bed he will start forgetting. The memories he would later go back to over and over, for that was all he had left now of her, would slowly crystalize, would become singular visions made of images alone and without the breath of life.

The bark of a far away dog echoes off a nearby building. The man turns and notices the sunlight making lines across the hardwood floor through the blinds. The only sound in the room is that of his own breathing.

He rises and walks to the phone hanging on the wall with its archaic ten foot cord. He calls a number. He turns and sees her face. She is still sleeping. He wants to bend down and kiss her he wants her to wake up and smile. He turns away tears in his eyes. He goes back to his side of the ed and sits down. He closes his eyes trying to forget everything that has happened since he opened his eyes this morning.

"Please," he thinks to himself, "just another minute, just one..." He closes his eyes.

As time passes the room fills with people. The paramedics file in with their gurney. He sits on the bed facing away as they pick her up, placing her on the gurney. Words are exchanged, papers are signed. Later his brother and sister are there. He runs out of tears eventually. His friends sit with him, bring him food. He tries not to leave the bed. She was here just a moment ago. He desperately needs to pound his head against a wall, but just rocks on the bed. His sister holds him.
