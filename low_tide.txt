He remembers them as slow undulations, the regular rising and falling, the crests and troughs of waves. He would wake before she did and lie on his side watching her breathe. Sometimes he would hear her breathing, other times he would notice only the movement of the cover. This morning his wife made no sound and the cover made no move.

He lies still on his side, staring, hoping, praying it is a trick of time, his mind strangely stretching the moment, slowing it down, making all movement imperceptible. He is frozen, his mind racing, filled with the past and future split by this single moment.

He eventually convinces himself to move. He reaches out to touch her but does so with dread. He knows it will be cold - his wife is no longer there.

She was on her side, facing away from him.

“Sleep well my love.”
“And you.” He turns off the lamp.

As soon as his fingers touched her back, the absence of heat, he felt his face twist, his stomach following suit. He cried out and tears filled his vision.

Through the seeming eternity of sorrow-filled convulsions, some with face buried in his pillow, others screaming, eyes shut, at the ceiling, he thought of the small moments.

The times he would stare at her across the table after he had finished his meal and her smiling when she noticed.

Long slow Sunday afternoons spent sitting in the living room, each of them reading, each comforted just by their proximity to one another.

Holding hands in the back of a cab, for no reason.

Once the shaking slowed he tried going back to one of those times. He wanted to feel those feelings again, to notice something new. He tried, but they were brief and without the spark of true experience.

He could smell her on the sheets - that sweatiness he had found odd twenty-odd years ago, but now missed if he travelled too many days a quarter.

He just wanted to hold her one more time, to feel her expand and contract in his arms, but he never would.

He would sleep alone tonight. He could already feel the absence in the room, in the bed.

She is looking up at him that first night in the bar. There is something about the way the grey of her shirt brings out the green in her eyes. He doesn’t want to rush this one.

There were things he needed to do, he knew, but the bed was the place he wanted to be. He couldn’t touch her, but he couldn’t leave her.

He knew as soon as he got out of the bed he would start forgetting. The memories he would go back to over and over, for that was all he had left now of her, would slowly crystalize, would become singular visions made of images alone and without the breath of life.

The echoes of a dog barking bounce off a nearby building. The man turns to watch the sunlight make lines across the hardwood floor.
