He remembered them as slow undulations, the regular rising and falling, the crests and troughs of waves. He would wake before she did and lie on his side watching her breathe. Sometimes he could hear her breathing, other times all he noticed was the movement of the cover.

This morning his wife made no sound and the cover did not move. He lay still on his side, staring, hoping, praying it was a trick of time, his mind strangely elongating this single moment, slowing it down to make all movement imperceptible. The moment ended and still there was no movement.

He still lay there in the bed, he had not moved since he noticed, hoping something would change. His mind raced, filled with the past and the future split by this single moment.

He eventually convinced himself he had to move. He had to reach out and touch her but he did so with dread. He knew it was going to be cold - his wife was no longer there.

She was on her side, facing away from him.

“Sleep well my love.”

“And you.” He turns off the lamp.

As soon as his fingers touched her back, the absence of heat, he could feel his face twist, his stomach following suit. A lightly throated cry came out of his twisted mouth and tears started to fill his vision.

Through the next seeming eternity of convulsions of sorrow, some with face buried in his pillow, others screaming, eyes shut, at the ceiling, he thought of the small moments.

The times he would stare at her across the table after he had finished his meal and her smiling when she noticed.

Long slow Sunday afternoons spent sitting in the living room, each of them reading, each comforted just by their proximity to one another.

Once the shaking slowed he tried to go back to one of those times. He wanted to feel those feelings again, to notice them anew. He tried, but they were brief and without the spark of true experience.

He could smell her on the sheets - that sweatiness he had found odd twenty-odd years ago, but now missed if he travelled too many days a quarter.

He just wanted to hold her one more time, to feel her expand and contract in his arms, but he never would.

He would sleep alone tonight. He could already feel the absence in the room, in the bed.

She is looking up at him that first night in the bar. There is something about the way the grey of her shirt brings out the green in her eyes. He doesn’t want to rush this one.

There were things he needed to do, he knew, but the bed was the place he wanted to be. He couldn’t touch her, but he couldn’t leave her.

He knew as soon as he got out of the bed he would start forgetting. The memories he would go back to over and over, for that was all he had left now of her, would slowly crystalize, would become singular visions made of images alone and without the breath of life.

The echoes of a dog barking bounce off a nearby building. The man turns to watch the sunlight make lines across the hardwood floor.
