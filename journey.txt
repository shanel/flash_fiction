Journey

He quickly moves aside and pulls the bike with him. He can feel the dirt slide and fall into his shoes as he steps a few inches down the hill. He tightens his grip on the bike frame and it stabilizes him.

He lets his eyes adjust again to the fading sunset, the car's lights leave flashbulbs when he blinks. He climbs back up to the asphalt and gently leans the bike on the ground and sits down next to it.

He pulls off the now-dust-covered canvas shoe and slaps the dirt and pebbles out. He slips it back on and does the other one. He stands up and puts the bike back on the road and continues walking home.

He can feel the swelling in his right eye. When the punch landed it was just like a car quickly coming around the corner -- a blast of light. He suddenly stops, feeling un able to move, seeing the punch coming again and being held to take it.

H looks to his left at the orange to darkness falling into the ocean. Tomorrow is Monday. They will be there waiting for him again after school. He keeps pushing the bike. At least he doesn't have to watch out for the pedals' movement as he walks, their having stolen the chain and all.

He shudders as a breeze comes up. He can smell the dampness in the air. He had no jacket. He would have been home by now if they had left him alone.

He beat one of the, at the fighting video game, so they took him outside and beat him. There would always be a "reason" for it, some imagined insult, something they didn't like in his voice.

Every day they would wait for him. They knew there was really only one way he could get home(he walked) and that is down the long flight of stairs at the side of the school: they ended in his neighborhood.

Another car is coming, he pulls the bike off the road and covers his eyes so he won't be blinded by the headlights. The darkness gets lighter and louder and then fades black and quiet again. He opens his eyes and keeps pushing the bike.

Sometimes he would try and stay at the school library at the end of the day but no matter how well he hid Mrs. Curtis would find him and tell him he would have to go. It was rare that he would out wait them.

The ocean was getting louder as the road moved further down the hill. He remembered a time his big brother would help him build sandcastles at the beach. they would always be gone when they went down the next day.

He didn't talk to his brother much these days. He was in the MArines and away a lot. He didn't think his brother ever got beaten up, he always was big and played sports. The boy never did sports. It hurt his chest to run too much.

He hadn't told his brother about getting picked on. He didn't want to sound like a wimp or a complainer.

He saw the lit sign for the neighborhood he lived in: "Oceanview." He didn't want to see his parents. Maybe he could just sit in the garage for while and wait till they went to sleep.

His father would quiz him about what he had done to aggravate the older boys and his mother would scold him about his shoes being dirty and that they weren't made of money.

He would go to his room and say he was going to sleep. He would wait until he heard his parents go to their bedroom and close the door. Then he would cry. He would scream into his pillow leaving a saltwater face in the whiteness.

He opened the door at the side of the garage as quietly as he could. His teeth are chattering. He leans his bike on the side of the garage and goes and sits on his brother's weight bench. His brother spent a lot of time out here getting strong.

He wished his brother would have taught him how to work out.

He thought maybe tonight would be the night he would find the courage to steal the paring knife from the block and put it in his backpack. He remembered some poster of his brother's saying "never bring a knife to a gunfight."

The flood light outside went off, and the garage fell into darkness. The boy lies on the bench and dreams of bloody knives.
