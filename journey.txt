Journey

The boy trips pulling the bike off the road. He slides down the hill, his calf exploding as it crashes into a piece of cactus. Tightening his grip on the bike frame he slows his decent. The car's engine quickly fades and is replaced by a cacophony of crickets.

Jason Black tripped the boy the day they met and had picked on him ever since. Earlier this week the boy had answered a question in class about Germany incorrectly. Jason, who sat behind him, whispered in his ear "my family's from Germany fucker, maybe after I kick your ass after school you'll study harder." Fear and nausea filled the rest of the day. After school they chased him down and threw him into a dumpster behind the school. He could still smell the rotting fruit his face had landed in.

Yesterday, after returning from the bathroom, Jason whispered in his ear "you go to the bathroom so much you'd think you lived there. Maybe you should!" That afternoon Jason and his friends locked him in the bathroom with the lights out. An hour later the janitor released him from the urine-stinking prison and sent him home.

He climbs back up the hill to the edge of the road. The sun is quickly falling into the ocean, darkening the red-orange sky. His brother always left for school early and the boy always got home late so the first time he would see his brother each day was around sunset, lifting weights in the garage with the door open to let the light in. His brother was very strong, it was one of the reasons the MArines wanted him. The boy had never been strong.

Two nights ago three Marines came to their home. He saw them approaching through the living room window. When the doorbell rang he went to his room and listened. A man spoke for a while and his mother cried. He climbed into the bed, covered his head, and tried to sleep.

Later that night his father came in and told him his brother wasn't coming home. The boy went back to sleep.

When he got home yesterday his brother's door was open and a big green box stenciled "PVT. C. HARRIS" sat in the middle of the room. While his mother was out shopping he looked through the box. Inside were clothes, CDs, and books. All were dusty. Hearing his mother returning he grabbed one of the books, closed the box, and ran back to his room.

That night he read the thin dogeared book. Sand fell into his bed as he turned the pages, it scraped him throughout the night. The book was a journal of sorts written by an ancient Roman emperor. He wrote that it was important to only care about the things you had control over and to act as though whatever you were doing now was the last thing you would ever do.

The boy continues walking along the road. Periodically a car will come by and when it does he steps off the road, moves his bike to make sure it isn't in the way, and waits for the car to pass. He instinctively avoids dangers. His afterschool actions are almost ritual now:

He sits sideways in the alcove, no part of his body shows in the aisle. He holds his backpack on his chest. He closes his eyes and prays the librarian will not find him and make him leave. He hopes to wait them out. Even when locked, the library doors opened from the inside. He hears the shuffling steps and knows he cannot stay.

He shudders as a breeze comes up. He can smell the salt ocean damp in the air. He has no jacket since he expected to be home by now. He hadn't planned on Jason Black having stolen his bike's chain.

The boy and his friends would often spend their Saturdays at the liquor store playing Beat Down 2. It was a video game where two characters beat each other up; each character had their own special moves. They would stand around playing, putting their quarters up on the glass to show they were in line. Sometimes Jason Black would show up with his friends. If he ended up playing against Jason he would play badly. He knew he could beat Jason, but never did. He knew it would be just another reason for Jason and his friends to beat him up.

He can just see the lights of the sign for "Oceanview Terraces," the neighborhood he lives in. He touches his face where the punch had landed, and quickly draws his hand back as the sting comes up. He had decided to give Jason a reason...

"Get out of the way, I'm playing next." The boy looked to his right and saw Jason Black step up to the machine and put his quarter in the slot. "Hey shit head, ready to get your ass handed to you?" He hadn't seen him come in, he must have been too focused on beating his previous opponent. He felt his insides twist. Jason chose the Roman soldier character. The boy thought about what the emperor had said.

With a spinning body slam the Brazilian wrestler finished off the centurion. A look of shock and a wave of anger flashed over Jason Black's face. "We'll be waiting for you outside," he said. "How about I just come out now and save everyone some time," said the boy.

The boy saw the car approaching, but continued walking. He wouldn't move off the road this time. As the car came over the rise its headlights blinded the boy and he closed his eyes, still walking. His vision fills with white star bursts on the black of his eyelids, just like those he saw when Jason's punch landed. And just like when Jason's punch landed, the boy smiles.
